This is pretty fast visa processing. Anyways, the time can be extended over a month if the application needs further examination. So, the applicants are reminded to apply early in advance for their visa.&nbsp;</p><p dir=\"ltr\">For work or long-term stay, applicants must get a Certificate of Eligibility. It needs to be collected from the regional Immigration bureau in Japan before their visa application. If the certificate is not submitted while applying for the visa, the processing time will take longer.
